    2. Install ExaSuite-6.2.4-RELEASE on VM1 (Licence Node)
        - @Welcome screen(6:exaconfig window) type 'install' and hit enter (this should trigger the installation process)
        ** you can monitor the logs by switching between tabs (Alt+Tab)
        - @select block device to install to: tab to 'OK' and hit enter
        - @Private network configuration: leave the settings as is, tab to 'OK' and hit enter
        - @EXAClusterOS installation: select 'Install EXAClusterOS on first boot', tab to 'OK' and hit enter
        - @Create maintenance user: enter a password, tab to 'OK' and hit enter
        - @Manual network configuration for public interface:
            1. open a terminal on Host OS (Windows key and then type CMD and hit enter)
            2. type IPCONFIG /ALL and hit enter
            3. find the IP that associated with an Ethernet card that has the following description (Description: VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter)
            4. if IP in IPCONFIG result is 192.168.56.1 then your n0010 ip address @Manual page should be 192.168.56.10
            5. delete Gateway ip value @Manual, tab to 'OK' and hit enter.
        - @Advanced network configuration: leave the settings as is, tab to 'OK' and hit enter
        ** if all steps were executed successfuly 'starting automated install ...... ' will be shown and will start installing the required packages.
        ** this step might take some time (depending on the number of CPUs and amount of RAM)
        ** at the end of this step 'Running post-installation scripts' is shown.
        - @Welcome screen type 'local' and hit enter.
        - select the first option (not the rescue mode) and hit enter.
        ** ignore 'failed to send logs ...' for now
        - @n0010 login:
            - enter 'maintenance' (it is the user that has been created during the installation)
            - enter the password that you set @Create maintenance user step (see above)
            - hit enter
            ** this will get you to 'License server status' menu **
        - hit refresh after a few minutes to see if the status of EXAoperation has been changed to 'Online', otherwise wait and hit refresh again after a few minutes.
        ** EXAClusterOS status must change to 'Running' during the wait **

    3. Testing if installation was successfull    
        - Once EXAoperation status is chenged to 'Online' 
            a. open a CMD and ping the Public IP address @Licence server status page, if successful you will get a reply
            (e.g.: ping 192.168.56.10)
            response: Reply from 192.168.56.10: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64
        open a web browser and navigate to https://<Public IP address @Licence server status page> (e.g: https://192.168.56.10)
        - your web browser will show a warning saying 'potential security risk', this is caused by self signed certificate that EXAoperation is using, ignore it and click in accept the risk.
        - @Welcome to EXAoperation page enter user name (admin) and password (admin)
        ** this can be changed after you are signed in **

    4. Enabling logging for Licence Node in EXAoperation
        ** for most of the steps in this part you can use ctrl+f in your browser to find the link**
        - navigate to monitoring
        - @EXACluster Monitoring Services select 'Add'
        - @Add Log Service
            a. Minimum Log Priority=Information
            b. EXAClusterOS Services=EXAoperation, DWAd, Lockd, Load, Storage, Authentication
            clikc on 'Add'
        This will redirect you to '@EXACluster Monitoring Services', with a logging service shown as 'logservice1'
        - open 'logservice1' in a new tab and click on 'Tail', change the 'Error Level' to 'Information', change the End time to some time in future (tomorrow)
        ** it should show you a message like '2020-02-09 21:01:21.516901	Notice	EXAoperation	Successful authentication with username "admin"'

    5. Configuring Network on Licence Node
        - from left menue, under 'Configuration' click on 'Netwrok'
        - @System tab, click on 'edit' and make sure that the following values are set:
            a. Public Network=192.168.56.0/24 (this ip range is the same as you have seen @Manual network configuration in step 2)
            b. Gateway= delete any value in this text field, it must be empty
            c. NTP Server 1, 2, 3= delete any value in this text field, it must be empty
            click on 'Apply'
    6. Installing ExaSuite-6.2.4-RELEASE on Data Node (VM2)
        - from letf side menu, under 'Configuration' click on 'Nodes'
        - under 'Nodes' click on 'Add' to go to 'Add EXACluster node' (e.g. for url: https://192.168.56.10/cluster1/+/AddNode.html)
        - click on 'Add' to add a 'Disk Device' with path '/dev/sda'
        - set 'Disk Raid' to 'None'
        - set 'Disk Encryption' to 'AES 256'
        - set 'Disk Raid' to 'None'
        - set 'MAC Private LAN' to Step 1, VM2, part e, Adapter1 MAC Address
        ** put a colon between every second character, e.g.: 08:00:27:8E:CC:63 **
        - set 'MAC Private LAN' to Step 1, VM2, part e, Adapter2 MAC Address
        ** put a colon between every second character, e.g.: 08:00:27:FD:D2:8E **
        - leave the rest as is, click 'Add'
        ** now you should be able to see the new data node under 'Nodes' with its MAC Addresses **
        - click on '<node name, e.g.: n0011>', it must go to 'EXACluster Node Information for node n001' in 'https://192.168.56.10/cluster1/n0011'
        - click on 'Disk', it will go to 'EXACluster Disk Information for node n0011' in 'https://192.168.56.10/cluster1/n0011/disks.html'
        - select the first one (d00_os, type 'OS') and click on 'Edit'
        - on 'EXACluster node disk properties' click on 'Add' and set it to '/dev/sda', Size of Disk (GiB) to '50' and click 'Apply'
        - select next disk (d01_swap, type 'Swap') and click on 'Edit'
        - on 'EXACluster node disk properties' click on 'Add' and set it to '/dev/sda' and click 'Apply'
        - select next disk (d02_data, type 'Data') and click on 'Edit'
        - on 'EXACluster node disk properties' click on 'Add' and set it to '/dev/sda' and click 'Apply'
        - select next disk (d03_sorage, type 'Storage') and click on 'Edit'
        - on 'EXACluster node disk properties' click on 'Add' and set it to '/dev/sdb' and click 'Apply'
        - fire up the VM2 from VirtualBox GUI.
        NOTE: this will take some time, wait until you see the logs as explained below.
        ** once VM2 is on, you must be able to see a log from Service 'booting' stating that the boot process stage 2 has been started for ... **
        ** if boot process was successful, you will see a log like this 'Got quorum back with <2> active processes of <2> overall processes.' **
        - on 'Nodes', if the 'State/Op.' for n0011 is 'Running To Install' from 'Actions' drop down list choose 'Set active flag' and click 'Execute'
        ** the 'State/Op.' must change to 'Running Active'
        
    7. Configuring Storage unit for Data Node
        - on 'EXAStorage' under 'Service' inspect Node's 'State', if it in 'Running' mode, click on 'Startup Storage Service'
        - select n0011 and click on 'Add Unused Disks'
        ** this should change the 'd03_sorage' to 100 GiB **

    8. Adding a data voulume
        - on 'EXAStorage', click on 'Add Volume' and set the following parameters, then click on 'Add':
            Redundancy=1
            Allowed Users=admin (select admin and click on the arrow pointing to right for setting it)
            Volume Size (GiB)=30
            Nodes List=n0011 (select n0011 and click on the arrow pointing to right for setting it)
            Number of Master Nodes=1
            Disk=d03_sorage
        ** if successful, you should see a log in monitoring console similar to 'Label 'user:0' has been added to volume 0.'
    
    9. Creating a database
        - on 'EXASolution' from 'Services' on the left side menu and click on 'Add' to create a database with the following parameters:
            DB Name=<some_name>
            Active Nodes=1
            Node List=n0011 (select n0011 and click on the arrow pointing to right for setting it)
            DB RAM (GiB)=3 (specified during VM2 installation)
        ** the DB Name value <some_name> is shown under 'EXASolution Instances' with the 'Status' of 'Not created'
        - click on <some_name> link, and from 'Actions' drop down list select 'Create'. click on 'Submit'
        ** if successful, a log entry similiar to 'Set owner of system to UID = 1000 (exasolution), GID = 1000.' is shown in monitoring.
        - 'Actions' entry is now changed to 'Startup', click on 'Submit' again to start the database
        ** if successful, 'System is ready to receive client connections.' will appear in monitoring.
        - clicl on 'EXASolution' to see the 'Connection String'
    
    10. Test database is accessible
        use a SQL client to execute a query (SELECT * FROM SYS.EXA_VOLUME_USAGE WHERE TABLESPACE='PERSISTENT';
                                             SELECT LOGIN_TIME, CLIENT FROM SYS.EXA_ALL_SESSIONS WHERE ENCRYPTED=TRUE;)

Done!
